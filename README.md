üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jonathan, a sophomore (junior-standing) at Santa Clara University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. The emphases I am specializing in are software, security, and algorithms.

At SCU, I am a member of ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and BroncoSec (Security Club and CTF Team), as well as a moderator for the SCU Discord Network.

I am currently working as a freelance problem setter for HackerRank, making problems for practice sets, certification tests, coding contests, and technical interviews (for partnered companies). I am also tutoring 3 high school students to teach them important programming concepts and skills for classes and competitions.

In my free time, I do a lot of programming and CTF competitions (CTFTime - team L10n5).

I pinned my 6 most recent CTF writeups. Here's the link to my [Linear Algebra Notes](https://github.com/csn3rd/LinearAlgebraNotes/wiki) so you don't have to scroll through all my repos.
