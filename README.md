üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jonathan, a sophomore (junior-standing) at Santa Clara University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. The emphases I am specializing in are software, security, and algorithms.

At SCU, I am a member of ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and BroncoSec (Security Club and CTF Team), as well as a moderator for the SCU Discord Network.

I am currently working as a freelance problem setter for HackerRank, making problems for practice sets, certification tests, coding contests, and technical interviews (for partnered companies). I am also tutoring 3 high school students to teach them important programming concepts and skills for classes and competitions.

In my free time, I do a lot of programming and CTF competitions (CTFTime - team L10n5).

To learn more about me, visit my website at https://www.CSN3RD.com (or click on the gif below) and check out my resume at https://www.CSN3RD.com/JonathanHoResume.pdf. My projects and competition write-ups can be found on my Github at https://github.com/CSN3RD.

I am currently looking for a software engineering internship or entry-level position for Summer 2021. Please email me at jonathan.ho.ca@gmail.com if you are hiring!

I also love to meet new people and learn new things so feel free to reach out and connect with me. Here are some of my social media accounts:

I pinned my 6 most recent CTF writeups. Here's the link to my [Linear Algebra Notes](https://github.com/csn3rd/LinearAlgebraNotes/wiki) so you don't have to scroll through all my repos.
