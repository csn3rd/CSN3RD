üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Jonathan, a second year (junior-standing) at Santa Clara University, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. The emphases I am specializing in are software, security, and algorithms.

I am involved with a variety of organizations at SCU. I am on the moderation and development teams for the school Discord server, which has over 700 members. I am the 2021-2022 external CTF Coordinator / Team Captain for BroncoSec, SCU's security club/team. I am also an active member of Santa Clara's ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) Chapter.

I am currently working as a freelance problem setter for HackerRank, making problems for practice sets, certification tests, coding contests, and technical interviews (for partnered companies). I am also tutoring 3 high school students to teach them important programming concepts and skills for classes and competitions.

In my free time, I do a lot of programming and CTF competitions (CTFTime - team L10n5).
